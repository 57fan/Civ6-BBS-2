			<Text>A combination of factors creates the necessary conditions for bioluminescence: red mangrove trees surround the water, a complete lack of modern development around the bay, the water is cool enough and deep enough, and a small channel to the ocean keeps the dinoflagellates in the bay. This small channel was created artificially, being the result of attempts by the occupants of Spanish ships to choke off the bay from the ocean. The Spanish believed that the bioluminescence they encountered there while first exploring the area, was the work of the devil and tried to block ocean water from entering the bay by dropping huge boulders in the channel. The Spanish only succeeded in preserving and increasing the luminescence in the now isolated bay.</Text>

Once removed from the mountain, it was taken by llama and mule to the coast where it was then loaded onto treasure ships sailing back to Europe. Nearly 41,000 tons of pure silver were mined over the course of 200 years, 8,200 of which went directly to the Spanish crown. After 1800, the main silver mines were depleted, but the mining of Potosi still continues today - some for silver but now mostly for tin.</Text>

			<Text>Dallol is a cinder cone volcano in the Danakil Depression, northeast of the Erta Ale Range in Ethiopia. It has been formed by the intrusion of basaltic magma into Miocene salt deposits and subsequent hydrothermal activity. Phreatic eruptions took place in 1926, forming Dallol Volcano while numerous other eruption craters dot the salt flats nearby. These craters are the lowest known subaerial volcanic vents in the world, at 45 m (150 ft) or more below sea level.</Text>

The Grand Mesa has a layer of volcanic basalt on top, which resists erosion. It did not so much rise into the air, as it remained at its original height, as the surrounding terrain was eroded by the action of the Colorado and Gunnison rivers.  The Grand Mesa National Forest (originally called Battlement Mesa Forest Reserve) was created by Benjamin Harrison on December 24, 1892. It was the third forest reserve created in United States.</Text>

The first historical records of the lake come from Arab traders seeking gold, ivory and other commodities from the natives as they pushed inland from the coast. The search by European explorers for the source of the Nile led to the discovery of the lake by the Englishman John Speke in 1858 AD, who named it after the then British monarch.</Text>

The eruption destroyed over half of the island, and was heard in parts of Australia, some 3,200 kilometers (2,000 miles) away. Some 37,000 people were killed by the eruption and subsequent tsunamis. The volcano has been emitting lava steadily for the past eighty years, rebuilding the cone at a rate of about 5 meters per year (15 feet per year).</Text>

Captured from Spain by the English and Dutch in 1704 and ceded to England in 1713, Gibraltar has been a British possession ever since (much to the annoyance of Spain, which wants it back). Commanding the entrance to the Atlantic from the Mediterranean, Gibraltar has been a major British naval base for three hundred years. Most of Gibraltar is covered by the 'Rock', a huge formation of shale, sandstone and limestone thrust up by the unimaginable power of plate tectonics. The Rock stands some 430 meters (1400 feet) in height. At one time Gibraltar was a massive fortification allowing Britain to dominate the narrow Mediterranean-Atlantic passage, but today the island is more of a nature preserve and tourist destination than it is a military base.</Text>

First seen by Europeans in 1870 (and by natives some 10,000 years before that), Old Faithful was thus named because of the regularity of its eruption. The geyser shoots a column of boiling water to a height of some 30-50 meters (100-175 feet) every 60-90 minutes (the interval determined by the ferocity of the previous eruption). Geysers occur when subterranean water hits magma (molten rock). The water is instantly turned to steam, which rushes out the nearest available opening at tremendously high pressure. Old Faithful and the other 250 geysers in Yellowstone are enjoyed by some three million visitors each year.</Text>
